                    <h4>Reflection</h4>
                    <p>Overall my primary school experience was great and I met many new people there. For someone who did not know how to socialise
                    at that age, primary school taught me how to be nice and that we should not be rude to others. In a nutshell, it was a good school
                and all the experiences I experienced brought me to where I am today. No regrets.</p>
