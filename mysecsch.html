                <p>Overall my secondary school experience was really awesome, ten times better than primary school. I met alot of really nice & awesome
                people there and in fact I still am keeping in contact with them and we even met up a few days ago to catch up with things that are happening
            lately. Some of them are also studying in the same school as I do now but just that we are all in different course. In a nutshell, secondary school
        has really amazing memories imprinted in my head and I will never forget everyone.</p>
