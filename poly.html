                    <h4>Reflection</h4>
                    <p>Poly was way different from primary and secondary school. Frankly, I couldn't cope with the new environment and teaching style.
                    It was tough socialising too since for some reason everyone just seemed different from me and I didn't have much people to talk to
                    However, I managed to overcome the obstacles and now I'm much better with coping with everything and I also met a few really nice people there.
